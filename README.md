# Crop Yield Prediction / Ann-MLR Hybrid Model

Predicting Crop Yeilds using an hybrid model callen Ann-MLR. 
Our prediction model is based on a complex hybrid 
algorithm that strategically combines the advantages of ANN 
(Artificial Neural Network) with MLR (Multiple Linear 
Regression). This intentional combination maximizes the 
different benefits that each element offers. The ANN 
component is particularly good at identifying complicated 
nonlinear patterns present in the data, which gives the model 
the ability to recognize and comprehend sophisticated 
relationships. At the same time, the MLR element is essential 
for improving interpretability as it provides information on the 
linear connections among the variables.

## Description

An exciting approach to estimating crop yields in the districts of Rajasthan, India, 
focusing on some primary crops that are essential to the 
agricultural system in the area. Our project included a novel 
hybrid model that skillfully combines Multiple Linear 
Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
